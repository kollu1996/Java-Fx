About:

Real Estate application which allows client to add 3 kinds of properties including its image and details such as Rent if apartment, purchase price if condominium or house. Number of bedrooms/bathrooms etc. I have given buttons to each of the property

When clicked on each property a page is displayed where he can browse from local computer and add the image, enter details and submit finally.

4 display buttons are designed and programmed, 3 buttons each for house, condominium and appartment. 1 button for display all properties.

Used OOPS principles to solve problems such as code duplication. Inheritance is the solution that I used. Made a generic class property and included all common things and inherited those properties in house, condo and apartment.

Used polymorphism when adding property to array list (This contains all kinds of properties).
